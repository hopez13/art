      "message": "Hi,\n\nWhile studying ART, I found it useful to be able to collect atrace using perfetto for workloads running inside the chroot, this CL allows it by mounting tracefs using a bind mount.\n\nI realised after doing this that Ruben had done a similar patch here for simpleperf, https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/2611169, so this should help this use-case too.\n\nOne thing I noticed though is that I had to use a bind mount. If instead we mount tracefs with `mount -t tracefs`, it confuses the atrace service like so, over and over:\n\n    10-25 15:43:46.091     1     1 W init    : Killed 2 additional processes from a oneshot process group for service \u0027vendor.atrace-hal-1-0\u0027. This is new behavior, previously child processes would not be killed in this case.\n    ...\n    10-25 15:43:47.106     1     1 W init    : Killed 2 additional processes from a oneshot process group for service \u0027vendor.atrace-hal-1-0\u0027. This is new behavior, previously child processes would not be killed in this case.\n    \nAfter this, tracing no longer works, even outside of the chroot.\n\nI added a comment to that effect, but I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s going on.\n\nThanks!\nPierre",
