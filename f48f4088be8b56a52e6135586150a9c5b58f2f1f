      "message": "Before this change, if `options_.GetMinFirstSaveMs()` was less than `options_.GetSaveResolvedClassesDelayMs()`, we slept less. After the change, this is no longer the case.\n\nI think the change is expected, as the [document](https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/configure#:~:text\u003ddalvik.vm.ps%2Dmin%2Dfirst%2Dsave%2Dms) suggests that `dalvik.vm.ps-min-first-save-ms` is \"the **minimum** time to wait ...\", not guaranteeing that a save must be performed as soon as the time has passed.\n\nHowever, this is still a behavior change, so it\u0027s worth noting in the commit message.",

      "message": "yes, what I understand from the [document](https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/configure#:~:text\u003ddalvik.vm.ps%2Dmin%2Dfirst%2Dsave%2Dms) is that this is the min time to dump a profile to disk, so it has nothing to do with marking classes/methods as Startup (in memory), so the behavioral change here is only to mark classes as Startup once we get a StartupCompletion signal.",

      "message": "As discussed, it\u0027s better to perform a first save before we enter the `while` loop (with a sleep if `force_early_first_save` is true).\n\nThe first save can also make the logic in the `while` loop simpler because we no longer need to deal with `force_early_first_save` in the loop.",

      "message": "Thinking again. I found that in this case we are completely ignoring the `dalvik.vm.ps-min-first-save-ms`, since we need to wait at least the stated time to dump the profile to disk, so I wanted to keep the same profile dumping behavior, and then we can advice partners to make sure this sys-prop has a proper value",
