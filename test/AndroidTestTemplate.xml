        <!-- TODO: Check whether this the correct way to handle the expected
             output file ("expected.txt"). Currently, we do the following
             (inspired by the logic of
             vendor/google_tradefederation/core/prod-tests/res/config/google/oat/artruntest.xml
             and
             vendor/google_tradefederation/core/prod-tests/src/com/google/android/oat/ArtRunTest.java):

             1. push this file to the device in the target preparer
                (`PushFilePreparer`);
             2. pull that file from the device in the test runner
                (`ArtRunTest`);
             3. compare this file with the actual output in the test runner.

             This does not seem efficient; we could just fetch the file directly
             from its original location in the test runner instead, but it's not
             clear whether this is a recommended TradeFed idiom. -->
