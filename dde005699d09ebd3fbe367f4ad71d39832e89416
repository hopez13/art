      "message": "I think this explanation is a bit confusing. It sounds like we don\u0027t care about leaking the old elements, but what actually happens here, iiuc, is that `map` has non-owning pointers to all the elements in `collection_`, exactly one each, and this just reshuffles the owning pointers so that all elements are safely in unique_ptr\u0027s again at the end of the loop. Or that\u0027s how I hope it is, because otherwise I can\u0027t see how it works.\n\nCan you please improve the comments to explain it better? The function comment should specify the assumptions on the map argument.",

      "message": "On a second glance, what if we sidestep completely the problem explained in the comment by making use of `std::swap`? If I understand correctly, we might be running into trouble sometimes because we have duplicates of the unique pointers during the execution of `SortByMapOrder` - but if we reorder the vector by swapping items rather than releasing and resetting them, the problem should no longer be there (maybe at a small performance cost, but I imagine the length of the vector to be sorted is not going to be massive). What do you think?",

      "message": "I agree it would be quite nice to make it programmatically safe, if it can be done reasonably cheaply.\n\nHowever, swapping between owned and non-owned pointers isn\u0027t safe - you\u0027d have to do it between the unique_ptr\u0027s in `collection_` if it\u0027s to be of any use, and that means visiting them in a non-sequential order based on how they are moved around, which makes the loop rather complicated.\n\nOr am I missing something? If you see a way to do it easily then I\u0027m all for it.",
