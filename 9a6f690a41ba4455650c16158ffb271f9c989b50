      "message": "From what I understand this helps making the PALette interface complete, but I\u0027m not sure I have the full picture on this either. Orion might be able to fill us in?\n\nBtw speaking of system dependencies, can mention that I\u0027m not addressing the system properties functions here. They go through Bionic libc and end up accessing files iiuc (http://cs/aosp-master/bionic/libc/system_properties/contexts_split.cpp), so I reckon they\u0027re not a problem.",

      "message": "We\u0027ve looked at extending and depending on the NDK, but it just seems like the wrong level and the stuff we need is very particular to ART.\n\nIf we have a small abstraction library that interposes on the system interactions, then it\u0027s pretty clear where our dependencies lie. I don\u0027t see any reason why not to use it on host too. Then if you don\u0027t have liblog, you can use a host specialized version of the abstraction library and not have to special case as many dependencies for host and target.",
