      "message": "Are you sure this is safe? The runtime assumes that there is at most one stack map per native_pc_offset, e.g. when searching for a deoptimize or try/catch stack map (go/stack-map-native). If the previous HIR instruction generated a stack map for its last native instruction, this will generate another one with the same native pc offset.\n\nIt\u0027s probably fine for the moment because GetStackMapForNativePcOffset does a linear search and will thus always return the first encountered stack map, but we\u0027ve been planning to change it to binary search.\n\nEither way, I feel like this is breaking an implicit agreement between the compiler and the runtime (which we should probably try to enforce in the stack map stream) and should at least be better documented. If it were up to me, I\u0027d emit a NOP to bump the native_pc as a safety net.",

Each is generated for a different HInstruction, likely with a different HEnvironment because the non-NativeDebugInfo instruction will have overwritten its output vreg. Since you generate NativeDebugInfos at the beginning of basic blocks, they\u0027re not even guaranteed to come from two subsequent HInstructions.\n\nAnd yes, it is absolutely critical that the runtime picks the correct one, otherwise it will look for values of vregs in the wrong locations. Deoptimization might then wrongly initialize the interpreter and try/catch will set wrong values of phis in the catch block.",

      "message": "Nope. The dex register map is generated from the HEnvironment of the HInstruction which reflects the mapping state before the HInstruction, not the native instruction. Since an HInstruction may emit multiple native instructions, the stack map reflects neither the state before nor after that native instruction. It is simply generated at an address where it is easily locatable by the runtime, typically at the end.\n\nYou also need to realize that the location mapping is not generated by codegen but by the register allocator. Each HInstruction is given its own linear-scan position and the register allocator can generate a different mapping at each position. Since the debug info has its own HInstruction, it will also get its own position different from other HInstructions. There\u0027s no connection to the resulting native pcs whatsoever.\n\nBut as I said from the start, all you need to do is emit a NOP before you call RecordPcInfo. Your stack map will get a unique native_pc and life will be swell again. Since that\u0027s a single instruction, you can also assume that such stack map reflects the state of the world before it.",
