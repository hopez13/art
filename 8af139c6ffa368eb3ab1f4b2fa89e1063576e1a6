      "message": "\u003e It has been the behavior for years that we override the compiler filter specified by -m for debuggable, useEmbeddedDex, etc.\n\nTo be clear, this discussion is about when it\u0027s forced, i.e. `-f` as well. But indeed, in the legacy code the force flag didn\u0027t affect the filter overrides in [getRealCompilerFilter](https://source.corp.google.com/h/googleplex-android/platform/superproject/udc/+/udc-dev:frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/pm/PackageDexOptimizer.java;l\u003d797;drc\u003d678d5087e114fe4c21f3d9c2417dcfd76ea1cfcd) so that\u0027s a point. Guess what I\u0027m going for would require a new flag such as `--force-filter`, but I\u0027m not asking for that.\n\n(Btw, there\u0027s still another open comment on this CL.)",
