Does it mean that libdexfile_support, libdexfile_external and all its dependencies are compiled for the host (read x86) arch and end up somewhere in /system/lib? And that is besides the ordinary libs in /system/apex/com.android.art/lib?\n\nIf so, there could be a potential for ODR violations between the two sets of libs?",

      "message": "Thanks for the clarifications. It still means that all these libraries end up in /system/lib, in addition to their normal instances in /apex/com.android.art?\n\nI assume APEX updatability still isn\u0027t a factor for native_bridge use cases. Even so, if the above is correct then it\u0027s a setup I doubt we\u0027d be able to support. One reason is the different linker namespace configuration, another is the risk of ODR issues.\n\nWould it be possible to bridge the native ABI from libdexfile_external.so to the guest and use native_bridge_supported on libdexfile_support only? It\u0027s a C interface that is fairly small: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:art/libdexfile/external/include/art_api/dex_file_external.h\n\nI might also mention that it\u0027s easy to create a dummy libdexfile_support that does nothing and depends on nothing (-DNO_DEXFILE_SUPPORT), as a stop-gap fix to decouple this from the rest.",

Whether this matters or not depends on how the assumption is used, but it might matter.\n\n\u003e I think dummy library would work just fine for our use-case, too /.../\n\nGood, can we pursue that for now then? If you\u0027re only coming from libbacktrace then I think the best way is to just add a native_bridge target clause there with -DNO_LIBDEXFILE_SUPPORT in it - there are a few already: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:system/core/libbacktrace/Android.bp;l\u003d117-122;drc\u003ded96fe1d305d7842e21dc8dc9255bcf7e3139e7d That way I think this CL can be dropped altogether.\n\nOtherwise basically the same approach on libdexfile_support should do the trick.\n\nThe effect of this is of course that stack unwinding wouldn\u0027t provide function and offset for dex stack frames, but it wouldn\u0027t error out either.",
