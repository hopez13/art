      "message": "This is close, but I was actually more interested in live_bytes / RoundUp(BytesAllocated(), kRegionSize), as it is used in the evacuation decision. If we\u0027ve barely allocated in a region, it\u0027s still mostly empty.\n\nIf it\u0027s feasible to compute, I\u0027d also like to know \u003clength of longest free run\u003e / \u003cfree bytes in region\u003e .\n\nIf we\u0027re spending a lot of time evacuating regions that have nearly all the empty space already contiguous, then it may be worth moving away from the pure copying strategy.",
